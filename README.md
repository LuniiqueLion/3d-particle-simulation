# Description

A large-scale gravitational particle simulation (400 000+ particles) in 3D space using the Barnes-Hut approximation. This project demonstrates spatial partitioning with octrees for optimizing N-body simulations.

## Features

- Simulates gravitational interaction of massive particle systems in 3D
- Integrated real-time visualization with the 3D Terrain Visualizer
- Newtonian mechanics with time-step integration

## Technologies

- Python
- NumPy
- Pygame

## Performance

- Simulates 400,000+ particles with significant optimization over O(nÂ²) algorithms

## Controls

- Mouse scroll: Zoom
- arrow keys + D + Q: Rotate view
- F : reset view


## Preview
black-hole like structure forming at 400 000 particles.
